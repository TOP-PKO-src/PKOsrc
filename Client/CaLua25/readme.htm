<p>CaLua 2.5 by Justin Reynen (justinreynen@hotmail.com), January 30 2004.<br>

For a copy of the LGPL, see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, you can use this product in a commercial product, as long as CaLua is 
externally
linked to the program (using a dll) and credit is given to me and/or CaLua. 
Basically, all
I'm hoping to get out of this is that people will use what I've created, and 
give me credit. If you alter CaLua in any way, you must make your tree of the 
source available for download.</p>

<p>If you get ANY use out of CaLua, please e-mail me (justinreynen@hotmail.com) and 
let me
know.<br>

===================<br>
= Changes from 2.4<br>
===================</p>

<p>- Bug fix with multiple CaLua states (thanks to Ted Koenig (sp?))<br>
<br>
==========================<br>
= Building and installing<br>
==========================<br>
Prebuilt versions of Lua and CaLua in both debug and release form can be 
found in the 'lib' directory.</p>

<p>
<br>
Halfway through development, I upgraded to Visual Studio .net from VC++ 6.0. If 
you can build Lua, you should be able to build CaLua from scratch. I've included 
pre-built versions of Lua and CaLua in both debug and release form, which should 
work for anyone running window.<br>
<br>
==========================<br>
= Thanks<br>
==========================</p>

<p>Thanks for trying out CaLua. I'm always interested in what people are doing 
with CaLua, their projects, questions, or just talking shop. Drop me a line if 
you want to discuss licensing issues or perhaps offer me a job :). Thank you for 
acknowledging my little contribution to the world of Open Source Software.</p>
